# Demo code for Fall 2023 COMP 1701, Section 003
This is an unfiltered dump of all the code that gets written during lectures. I'll try to keep it updated after each one, but there may be a day or two delay if I forget to push changes.

Feel free to clone this repo to play around! Cloning does not make any changes or notify me that you've grabbed a copy, so don't be shy.
